## Course Description

React applications can be easy to start from scratch, but how can you update and evolve your legacy React applications in a way that ensures compatibility and makes use of existing features? Use the ChatGPT API, of course! In this course designed for developers maintaining older React codebases, software developer and instructor Eve Porcello helps you seamlessly add conversational AI features without the need for a complete rewrite. Learn how to work with class components, manage API calls, and build intuitive user interfaces powered by ChatGPT. Use hands-on examples and real-world scenarios to master techniques to handle API errors, optimize performance, and create engaging user experiences. Whether you're maintaining enterprise software or upgrading a personal project, this course gives you the skills you need to build and maintain apps without the legacy system headaches.
